# Repository for Holberton Machine Learning projects.
Computers can learn similarly as we do. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). Conventionally, algorithms are instructions to computers for solving a particular problem. The paradigm of Machine learning algorithms is to train computers with big sets of data inputs and by statistical analysis output (predict) values that are in a specific range.

This repository is entirely written in Python (*.py) and Jupyter Notebook (\*.ipynb), and has 4 categories of projects that are the base of Machine Learning.

The first category is "Math", which includes Linear Algebra, Plotting, Calculus, Probability, Convolutions and Pooling, Advanced Linear Algebra, Multivariate Probability, and Bayesian Probability.

The second category is "Supervised Learning", in which input data is labeled so that after training, the machine can predict labels for unseen data.
